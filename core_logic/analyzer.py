          Now, analyze the following resume text based on these examples. If a value for any field is not found, use `null`. For lists, use an empty list `[]`.

          **Resume Text to analyze:**
          ---
          {resume_text}
          ---
          ...
          **RULES TO FOLLOW:**
          1.  **Do Not Hallucinate:** If information is not present in the resume text, you MUST use `null` or `[]`. Do not invent or infer data.
          2.  **Be Concise:** Keep summaries and responsibility descriptions brief and to the point.
          3.  **Calculate Experience:** For `total_experience_years`, estimate the total years based on the dates provided in the work history. If no dates are present, make a reasonable estimation from the text.
          4.  **Extract Skills Verbatim:** Extract skills as they are written in the resume. Do not add skills that are not explicitly mentioned.
